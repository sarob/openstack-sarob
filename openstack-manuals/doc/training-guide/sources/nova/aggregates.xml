<title>Page Abstract</title>
<para>    Host aggregates can be regarded as a mechanism to further partition
    an availability zone; while availability zones are visible to users,
    host aggregates are only visible to administrators. Host aggregates
    started out as a way to use Xen hypervisor resource pools, but has
    been generalized to provide a mechanism to allow administrators to
    assign key-value pairs to groups of machines. Each node can have
    multiple aggregates, each aggregate can have multiple key-value
    pairs, and the same key-value pair can be assigned to multiple
    aggregate. This information can be used in the scheduler to enable
    advanced scheduling, to set up xen hypervisor resources pools or to
    define logical groups for migration.

  <para>
    Originally all aggregates were Xen resource pools, now an aggregate
    can be set up as a resource pool by giving the aggregate the correct
    key-value pair.
  </para>
  <para>
    You can use aggregates for XenServer resource pools when you have
    multiple compute nodes installed (only XenServer/XCP via xenapi
    driver is currently supported), and you want to leverage the
    capabilities of the underlying hypervisor resource pools. For
    example, you want to enable VM live migration (i.e. VM migration
    within the pool) or enable host maintenance with zero-downtime for
    guest instances. Please, note that VM migration across pools (i.e.
    storage migration) is not yet supported in XenServer/XCP, but will
    be added when available. Bear in mind that the two migration
    techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination
    for a higher level of flexibility in your cloud management.
