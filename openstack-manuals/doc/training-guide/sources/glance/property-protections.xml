<para>  There are two types of image properties in Glance:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Core Properties, as specified by the image schema.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      Meta Properties, which are arbitrary key/value pairs that can be
      added to an image.
    </para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
  Access to meta properties through Glance's public API calls may be
  restricted to certain sets of users, using a property protections
  configuration file.
</para>
<para>
  This document explains exactly how property protections are configured
  and what they apply to.
</para>

  <title>Constructing a Property Protections Configuration File</title>
  <para>
    A property protections configuration file follows the format of the
    Glance API configuration file, which consists of sections, led by a
    <literal>[section]</literal> header and followed by
    <literal>name = value</literal> entries. Each section header is a
    regular expression matching a set of properties to be protected.
  </para>
  <blockquote>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">note</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      Section headers must compile to a valid regular expression,
      otherwise a <emphasis role="strong">500 Internal Server
      Error</emphasis> will be thrown on server startup. Regular
      expressions will be handled by python's re module which is PERL
      like.
    </para>
  </blockquote>
  <para>
    Each section describes four key-value pairs, where the key is one of
    <literal>create/read/update/delete</literal>, and the value is a
    comma separated list of user roles that are permitted to perform
    that operation in the Glance API.
  </para>
  <para>
    The path to the file should be specified in the
    <literal>[DEFAULT]</literal> section of
    <literal>glance-api.conf</literal> as follows.
  </para>
  <blockquote>
    <programlisting>
property_protection_file=/path/to/file
</programlisting>
  </blockquote>
  <para>
    If this config value is not specified, property protections are not
    enforced. If the path is invalid, a <emphasis role="strong">500
    Internal Server Error</emphasis> will be thrown on server startup.
  </para>
  <para>
    Property protections are applied in the order specified in the
    configuration file. This means that if for example you specify a
    section with <literal>[.*]</literal> at the top of the file, all
    proceeding sections will be ignored.
  </para>
  <para>
    If a property does not match any of the given rules, all operations
    will be disabled for all roles.
  </para>
  <para>
    If an operation is misspelled or omitted, that operation will be
    disabled for all roles.
  </para>
  <para>
    Disallowing <literal>read</literal> operations will also disallow
    <literal>update/delete</literal> operations.
  </para>
  <para>
    A successful HTTP request will return status
    <literal>200 OK</literal>. If the user is not permitted to perform
    the requested action, <literal>403 Forbidden</literal> will be
    returned.
  </para>
</section>
<section xml:id="v1-api-x-glance-registry-purge-props">
  <title>V1 API X-glance-registry-Purge-props</title>
  <para>
    Property protections will still be honoured if
    <literal>X-glance-registry-Purge-props</literal> is set to
    <literal>True</literal>. That is, if you request to modify
    properties with this header set to <literal>True</literal>, you will
    not be able to delete or update properties for which you do not have
    the relevant permissions. Properties which are not included in the
    request and for which you do have delete permissions will still be
    removed.
