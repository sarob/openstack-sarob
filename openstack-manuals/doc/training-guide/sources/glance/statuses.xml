<para>  Images in Glance can be in one the following statuses:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>queued</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      The image identifier has been reserved for an image in the Glance
      registry. No image data has been uploaded to Glance and the image
      size was not explicitly set to zero on creation.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>saving</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      Denotes that an image's raw data is currently being uploaded to
      Glance. When an image is registered with a call to POST /images
      and there is an x-image-meta-location header present, that image
      will never be in the saving status (as the image data is already
      available in some other location).
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>active</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      Denotes an image that is fully available in Glance. This occurs
      when the image data is uploaded, or the image size is explicitly
      set to zero on creation.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>killed</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      Denotes that an error occurred during the uploading of an image's
      data, and that the image is not readable.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>deleted</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      Glance has retained the information about the image, but it is no
      longer available to use. An image in this state will be removed
      automatically at a later date.
    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>
      <literal>pending_delete</literal>
    </para>
    <para>
      This is similiar to deleted, however, Glance has not yet removed
      the image data. An image in this state is recoverable.
